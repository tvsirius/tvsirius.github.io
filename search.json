    "text": "I am a creative, sharp-minded and self motivated professional. My background includes master’s degrees in Computer Systems Engineering and Cinema and Television Art. I had work experience in art, cinema and television before the war touched my country. Participating in volunteer work and providing assistance during the initial months of the war was a transformative event. Reconsidering my life, I fully realized my desire to return to Computer Science, to give my creative achievements a new life and to explore the newborn miracle of Artificial Intelligence.\nFrom that moment I spent more then several years of study in the fields of Software Development, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and much more. One of the real breakthroughs was my acceptance to the MIT Emerging Talent program. I am truly grateful to the Emerging Talent Team for my advancement, and for taking me further - to the MIT MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science, I have started this year.\nMy blend of Computer Systems Engineering and Cinema and Television Art master’s degrees, combined with my diverse experience and recent years of study have turned me into an ideal candidate for the roles in today’s rapidly evolving world - where AI and creativity walks hand in hand in the codespace of the future.\nI am ready to leverage emergent technologic innovations, ready to create, ready to transform a creative vision into action."
